# VBA Stuff
Unfortunately I have to use VBA for my work so here are some macros I've frankensteined together in the past

## Choropleth maps in excel
Used to color svg shapes from column fills, two options for manual fills and wrote the part for using conditional formatting colors instead. Main credit goes to [Clearly and Simply blog](https://www.clearlyandsimply.com/clearly_and_simply/2009/08/build-your-own-choropleth-maps-with-excel.html)

### Process
- Follow the instructions in the blog to create the SVG shapes so they each have the correct name (for simple maps it's easier to name them manually)
- Copy the code and adjust the sheet names in the code as necessary

## Word Userform for a multiple-choice dropdown
Using a Userform to populate a table cell with multiple possible options. Main credit goes to [Jay Freedman at Microsoft forums](https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/msoffice/forum/all/multiple-selection-from-a-drop-down-menu-in-ms/8b14e0fa-641c-4653-8e86-55353fe0cc30?page=2) (click on "more replies" to see the detailed answer)
